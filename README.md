## Usage with FSLiveTrafficLiveries (FSLTL)

### What is FSLTL?

**FSLTL** (FSLiveTrafficLiveries) is a similar project to AIG, offering a model matching solution and live traffic injection using real-time data from **Flightradar24**. FSLTL is a separate project and is **NOT INCLUDED** in the AIG download.

### Can I Use FSLTL and AIG Together?

Yes, you can use both **FSLTL** and **AIG** together. To do so, you will need to place the **VMR files** for both FSLTL and AIG into **vPilot**, ensuring that AIGâ€™s VMR file is at the top so it has priority for model matching.

- FSLTL is available for free through the [FlyByWire Installer](https://api.flybywiresim.com/installer).
