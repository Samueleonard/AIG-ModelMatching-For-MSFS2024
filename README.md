# AIG-Model Matching-For-MSFS 2024: 

## Introduction

This package provides the latest version of the [AlphaIndiaGroup](https://www.alpha-india.net) (AIG) AI traffic models for **MSFS 2024** in a single, easy-to-use download. It reduces the need to use the clunky and time-consuming installer from AIG, for a fast and simple setup.

Backwards compatibility to MSFS 2020 is not tested and no support will be given.

## Installation Instructions

### 1. **Download**
   Download the latest AIG pack from the provided link:
   - [Google Drive N/A]()  
     The file is a large zip archive (~XGB zipped download, ~XGB unzipped).

### 2. **Remove Previous AIG Installations**
   Before starting the installation, ensure that any previous AIG installs are removed from your **community folder**. This reduces the chances of conflicts or installation errors.

### 3. **Extract the Files**
   Use an extraction tool like **7zip** or **WinRAR** to extract **all included folders** into your **MSFS community folder**.
   - [Download 7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)
   - [Download WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/)

### 4. **Using AIG with VATSIM**
   If you are using **VATSIM** and want to use model matching, you will need a VMR file to link the models to their respective airlines. You will need to download one from a 3rd party, I recommend [this one](https://flightsim.to/file/23365/full-vatsim-aig-beta-model-matching) 
   You can then select it through the **'Custom Rules'** menu in vPilot settings.

**Important**: **Only** use the Google Drive download link provided above. **DO NOT** download from the GitHub repository, as this will **not** work.

## Manual Updates

As this pack may not be updated frequently, you may need to manually update your installation using the **AIG Manager Tool**. The tool is available for download [here](https://www.alpha-india.net/software/)

Please note that **no support is provided** for manual updates, and full compatibility cannot be guaranteed.

## Usage with FSLTL (FSLiveTrafficLiveries)

### What is FSLTL?

**FSLTL**  is a similar project to AIG, offering a model matching solution and live traffic injection using real-time data from **Flightradar24**. FSLTL is a separate project and is **NOT INCLUDED** in this download.

### Can I Use FSLTL and AIG Together?

Yes, you can use both **FSLTL** and **AIG** together. To do so, you will need to place the VMR files for both FSLTL and AIG into vPilot, ensuring that **AIGâ€™s** VMR file is at the **top** so it has priority for model matching.

- FSLTL is available for free through the [FlyByWire Installer](https://api.flybywiresim.com/installer).

## Usage with Online Networks (VATSIM)

A VMR file is not included in the download. You will need to download one from a 3rd party, i recommend [this one](https://flightsim.to/file/23365/full-vatsim-aig-beta-model-matching). 
Download and select it through the vPilot settings / Model Matching (FS2024) / Custom Rules / Add Custom Rule Sets

## Usage with Offline Traffic

The offline flight plans are included but have **not** been tested. Thus, compatibility is not confirmed and support wil not be given.

## Payware Models
AIG has the option to use payware  models in the installer, these **will not** be distributed in this free pack. Any payware models that are purchased by me will be removed from this package before distribution. Payware models will not be uploaded to the final download or to the GitHub repository.

If you choose to use payware model with AIG, you will need to manually update your installation using the [AIG Manager Tool](https://www.alpha-india.net/software/). No support is given for this.
